    description: "This project aims to enhance the in-cabin safety of autonomous vehicles by integrating real-time facial and voice recognition systems. The system is designed to detect weapons, unauthorized items, aggressive tones, unauthorized commands, and unusual passenger behavior to provide timely alerts and adaptive responses. Advanced YOLOv5 and CNN-based models were used for object detection, while voice recognition modules based on Wav2Vec 2.0 and DeepSpeech provided speaker verification and tone analysis. The system integrates multiple sensory inputs including cameras, microphones, and environmental sensors to enable real-time decision-making. The CARLA simulator was used to create realistic autonomous vehicle environments for system validation. An Emotion AI model was developed to monitor passengers' stress levels and dynamically adjust cabin features like lighting, temperature, and audio. This system architecture covers ethical decision-making, in-cabin security, and comfort adaptation. Technologies used include Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, Flask, YOLOv5, Wav2Vec 2.0, and CARLA Simulator. This multi-disciplinary project required significant collaboration across perception systems, AI, user comfort, and security domains, contributing a significant step forward in in-cabin safety innovations for autonomous vehicles."
